The Swiss Ephemeris (`pyswisseph` in Python) is a comprehensive library that can provide a vast amount of astronomical and astrological information about celestial bodies. Here are some key features and data that can be obtained using Swiss Ephemeris:

1. **Positional Information**:
    - Ecliptic Longitude, Latitude, and Distance
    - Equatorial Right Ascension and Declination
    - Daily motion (speed) in ecliptic coordinates
    - Heliocentric positions

2. **House Cusps, Ascendant, and Medium Coeli (MC)**:
    - You can compute house cusps, the Ascendant, and MC for a given location and time.
  
3. **Planetary Phenomena**:
    - Times of rising, setting, and culmination
    - Times of planetary stations (when a planet appears to stop before turning retrograde or direct)
    - Planetary ingresses (when a planet enters a new astrological sign)

4. **Planetary Aspects**:
    - Conjunctions, sextiles, squares, trines, oppositions, etc., between planets

5. **Eclipses**:
    - Dates and details of solar and lunar eclipses
    - Local circumstances of eclipses (e.g., times of beginning, maximum, and end)

6. **Sidereal Time**:
    - Compute the local apparent sidereal time for a given location and time.

7. **Planetary Moons**:
    - Positions of the major moons of planets, such as the Galilean moons of Jupiter.

8. **Fixed Stars**:
    - Get positions and other data related to prominent fixed stars.

9. **Time Conversions**:
    - Convert between Julian Day and Gregorian/Julian calendar dates.
    - Delta T computation (difference between Terrestrial Time and Universal Time).

10. **Ayanamsha Values**:
    - For sidereal astrology, it can compute the ayanamsha value for a given date.

11. **Planetary Nodes and Apogees**:
    - Positions of nodes and apogees (like Lilith or Black Moon) for the Moon and other planets.

This is just an overview, and Swiss Ephemeris has many other features and capabilities. For exact usage and details, it's recommended to refer to the library's official documentation and the Swiss Ephemeris book, which provides a deeper dive into its functionalities and the algorithms it uses.

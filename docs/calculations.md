- Astronomicalc alculations made by Astrotools are:
  - off by 14-16 minutes vs SolarFire tropical in case of ASC and MC. No difference in minutes from Moon out.
  - off by 8 minutes vs Jagannatha Hora sidereal LAHIRI in case of ASC and MC. No difference in minutes from Moon out.
  - off by at least 20 minutes vs AstroSeek LAHIRI in case of Moon. This is problematic because Moon is the basis of Vimshottari dasa.
  - off by 1-2 degrees in vs Astrolog tropical in case of faster planets
    - ASC and MC off by more then 10 degrees(must be a bug?)

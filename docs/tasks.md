Current:
- Implement vedic features
- phase, latitude

Bugs:
- Dec 08: there is a Merc-Jup Trine (240) in the timeline but it is not showing in the horoscope

TBD:
- Refactor tranits to use factories
- Add dependency injenction
- Add Lilith, Ceres, Chiron
- Add helio
- Implement eclipses
- Implement perigee/apogee
- Implement Sub Lords
- Aspect finder: I give an aspect and it lists all the occurences in date range
- Implement extremes (speed, declination)
- Speed/declination snapshot
- Event filtering
- Investigate discrepancy vs Astrolog
- Implement sidereal planet strength
- Implement cycles. For example: there is a Venus - Jupiter aspect coming up on the timeline. Have the option to go into it and show current past and future cycles

Timeline:
- Add geo and helio crossings (planet at the same degree)
- Add declination extremes
- Add latitude extremes
- Add speed extremes
- Helio changes
- Sidereal changes
- make it multithreaded

Horoscope:
- Add speed
- Printers: configure the fields to display


- Daily card investigation:
  - 3 months of cards from astromatrix
  - Map sun degree
  - Map sun degree diff vs natal


---------------------------------
Done:

- Implement Nakshatras
- Iron out code defficients (mp vs mpp, angle, aspect)

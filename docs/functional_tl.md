Absolutely, in Python, dependency injection can often be as simple as passing functions or objects as parameters. This approach leverages Python's dynamic typing and first-class functions. Hereâ€™s a basic example to illustrate how you can use this technique in your workflow.

### Example: Python Dependency Injection for Timeline Creation Process

Let's say you have a workflow with these components:

1. **JSON Parser**
2. **Config Validator**
3. **Timeline Factory**

#### Step 1: Define the Components

```python
# JSON Parser
def parse_json(json_string):
    # Parse the JSON string into a Python object (e.g., dictionary)
    return json.loads(json_string)

# Config Validator
def validate_config(config):
    # Perform validation logic on the config
    # Raise an exception or return a boolean
    if "key" not in config:
        raise ValueError("Invalid configuration")
    return True

# Timeline Factory
def create_timeline(config, additional_setup):
    # Use the config and additional setup to create a Timeline object
    if additional_setup:
        additional_setup()
    return Timeline(config)
```

#### Step 2: Implement Dependency Injection

In the main workflow, you can pass these functions as dependencies to another function that orchestrates the entire process.

```python
def process_timeline_creation(json_string, parser, validator, factory, setup=None):
    # Step 1: Parse the JSON
    config = parser(json_string)

    # Step 2: Validate the Config
    if not validator(config):
        raise Exception("Validation failed")

    # Step 3: Create the Timeline
    timeline = factory(config, setup)
    return timeline
```

#### Step 3: Define Additional Setup (Optional)

You can also have additional setup functions that can be injected into the process.

```python
def additional_setup():
    # Additional setup actions
    print("Performing additional setup...")
```

#### Step 4: Using the Process in Practice

Now, you can use this process in your application or for testing by passing different functions or mock implementations.

```python
# For actual usage
json_data = '{"key": "value"}'
timeline = process_timeline_creation(json_data, parse_json, validate_config, create_timeline, additional_setup)

# For testing, you can pass mock functions or objects
mock_parser = lambda x: {"mock_key": "mock_value"}
mock_validator = lambda x: True
mock_factory = lambda x, y: MockTimeline(x)
mock_timeline = process_timeline_creation(json_data, mock_parser, mock_validator, mock_factory)
```

### Conclusion

This example demonstrates how dependency injection in Python can be achieved by simply passing functions around. This approach is flexible and makes unit testing easier, as you can inject mock functions or objects to test each component independently.

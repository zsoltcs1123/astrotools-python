Current:
- Implement vedic features
  - To effectively analyze dasa, additional Vedic features needed

- Write functional OrbMap

Timeline:
- Add geo and helio crossings (planet at the same degree)
- Phase extremes (min/max elongations)
- Helio changes
- Make it multithreaded

Horoscope:
- Printers: configure the fields to display


- Daily card investigation:
  - 3 months of cards from astromatrix
  - Map sun degree
  - Map sun degree diff vs natal


---------------------------------
Done:
- Add sidereal
- Implement Nakshatras
- Iron out code defficients (mp vs mpp, angle, aspect)
- Implement transits to a horoscope (basic)
- Refactor horoscope
- Add NN, SN
- Implement vimshottari
- phase, latitude
- Investigate discrepancy vs Astrolog
- Speed/declination snapshot
- folder reorg
- extreme events

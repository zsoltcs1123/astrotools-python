- Helio changes
- Sidereal changes
- make it multithreaded

Horoscope:
- Add speed

- Daily card investigation:
  - 3 months of cards from astromatrix
  - Map sun degree

- Implement Nakshatras
- Iron out code defficients (mp vs mpp, angle, aspect)
- Implement transits to a horoscope (basic)
- Refactor horoscope
- Add NN, SN
- Implement vimshottari
